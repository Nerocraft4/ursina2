# ursina2
Small project related to Genetic Algorithms. Built with Python3 and ursinaEngine

<<WARNING>> The project is NOT complete and has a few bugs related to the ursina
module. Unfortunately, these bugs are caused by the engine itself and I cannot
do anything about it.

This is a simple project intended to showcase Genetic Algorithms and how they
work. It is not perfect, it is just meant to be a quick example.

In case you want more information about the subject, there is an article in my
blog page in Medium which describes the pseudocode and the general idea.
